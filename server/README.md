# Hotel Booking Extension

## Explanation

This service listens for user messages from Sunshine Conversations and responds with a button triggering a webview. The webview acts as a multi-page form, which when submitted makes a call to the backend of this service containing the data submitted by the user. The backend then calls Sunshine Conversations to echo the selection into the conversation as a user message.

## Prerequisites

These examples are built with node.js and npm.

## SETUP

1. run `git clone https://github.com/zendesk/sunshine-conversations-conversation-extension-examples.git`
2. run `npm install`
3. expose the port you're running this service on to the web (e.g. using a service like ngrok.io)
4. create a .env file with the credentials necessary to run this service using the .env.example as a guide
5. run `npm start` to run the server
6. configure a V2 webhook for _Conversation message_ events at `https://app.smooch.io/apps/APP_ID/webhooks` to point towards the ngrok/other link exposing the port being used at the route `/api/webhooks`

## Try it out!

1. open your browser to localhost:8000 or whichever port you specified in the .env file
2. click the "Add Messenger" button
3. check out the intents.js file to see what text can be used to trigger a conversation-extension button
